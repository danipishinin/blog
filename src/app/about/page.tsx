        About me
      </h1>
      <article className="text-justify">
        <p>
          I’m a postgraduate student in Software Engineering at USP, and I’ve
          been working in software development since 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I focus on building accessible and secure applications,
          with strong expertise in React Native, AWS, Testing Library, Jest,
          GraphQL, Sentry, and Datadog.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was also honored as a Google Women Techmakers ambassador for my
          contributions to technology and my commitment to the UN 2030
          Agenda—working to increase the representation of women in tech and
          reduce gender gaps through mentorship, events, and content creation
          (blog/vlog).
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of programming, I’m an avid climber, a certified scuba diver,
          and a mountaineering enthusiast. I collect books, smiles, and stories.
